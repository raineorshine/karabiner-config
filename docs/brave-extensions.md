# Brave extensions

Learned building the Extension Options popup (`scripts/extension-options/`): Cmd+Shift+, in Brave
opens a search box over every enabled extension that has an options page, and Enter opens the chosen
one's options page in a new tab.

## When a shortcut belongs in an extension instead of Karabiner

**A Brave-only shortcut that opens an extension's own UI belongs in the extension.** The manifest
declares it (`commands._execute_action.suggested_key`), Brave lists it and lets it be changed in
brave://extensions/shortcuts, and `_execute_action` opens the extension's popup under the toolbar —
a real popup, where a page Karabiner opens with `open -a` can only be a tab. A Karabiner rule adds a
shell spawn and a karabiner.json entry to get wrong (the first version of this one never loaded; see
[debugging.md](debugging.md) on config errors) and buys nothing while the scope is one browser.
Karabiner stays the answer for a shortcut that must work from other apps: Chrome documents extension
commands as global only on Ctrl+Shift+[0-9] (not tried).

## Moving parts

- **Source lives in `scripts/extension-options/`; Brave loads the copy in the live checkout's
  `scripts/bin/extension-options/`.** `scripts/install-extension-options.sh` copies one to the other
  from any worktree, the way `build-ax-press.sh` builds into `scripts/bin`. Brave stores the absolute
  path it loaded an unpacked extension from, so a copy loaded straight from a worktree breaks when
  the worktree is removed.
- **The manifest's `key` pins the id** (`mncnjnpmhmdjonlledbijmjdfdenkkbi`); without one, Brave
  derives the id from the load path. The id is the first 32 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the DER
  public key, each mapped 0-f to a-p. `openssl genrsa`, then `openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER`, then
  `openssl base64 -A` for the manifest (the `base64` on PATH here is GNU's, which has no `-i`). An
  unpacked extension never needs the private key.
- **Brave reads the pages from disk each time they open, and the manifest only on reload** — the
  reload button on the extension's card. Adding the `commands` entry to the already-loaded extension
  and reloading was enough for Brave to assign the suggested Cmd+Shift+,.
- **Loading and reloading are the user's click, every time.** Computer use grants browsers read-only.
  Claude in Chrome's `navigate` turns `brave://extensions` and `chrome://extensions` into
  `https://brave//extensions`. Neither reaches the Load unpacked folder picker, and
  `open -a 'Brave Browser' 'brave://extensions'` is ignored (nothing in the session log).

## Brave's own records

All JSON under `~/Library/Application Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Default/`, readable with
`jq` and no permission.

- **Installed extensions: `Secure Preferences`, `.extensions.settings`**, keyed by id — not
  `Preferences`. Unpacked entries (`location` 4) cache no manifest, only an absolute `path`, so name
  and options page come from `<path>/manifest.json`. Store installs (`location` 1) have `path`
  relative to `Extensions/`, `location` 5 is Brave's bundled components, and entries with no `path`
  are not loaded. There is no `state`: a disabled extension has a non-empty `disable_reasons`.
- **Brave's own shortcuts: `Preferences`, `.brave.accelerators`**, as Chromium accelerator strings
  (`Command+Comma`, `Command+Shift+KeyR`). This is how to check a chord is free in Brave. The System
  Events menu-bar read that AGENTS.md describes ran past 60s over Brave's menus without finishing.
- **Extension shortcuts: `Preferences`, `.extensions.commands`**, keyed like
  `mac:Command+Shift+Comma`, each naming the extension id and command. The entry appearing is the
  check that Brave actually assigned a suggested key.
- **`Sessions/Session_*` logs every navigation's URL** in plain text, so `strings` confirms a URL
  opened in the user's Brave without asking for anything. It cannot tell a page that loaded from one
  that was blocked: the blocked page keeps the URL.

## Dead ends

- **Building the list from those files.** A shell prototype worked, but it reverse-engineers a format
  that has already moved (settings to `Secure Preferences`, `state` to `disable_reasons`) and needs
  every unpacked manifest read from disk. With the `management` permission,
  `chrome.management.getAll()` returns `name`, `enabled` and `optionsUrl` directly.
- **Navigating a tab to another extension's page from an extension page.** `chrome.tabs.update` landed
  on "This page has been blocked by Brave" (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT), and setting `location.href`
  landed on `chrome-extension://invalid/`. `chrome.tabs.create` loads the page. Presumably Brave counts
  the first two as navigations the extension started, which another extension's pages refuse unless
  it lists them as web accessible.
- **Having the extension reload itself after an install.** `chrome.runtime.reload()` from its own page
  left a `--load-extension` copy unloaded, still blocked 8s later, with developer mode on in that
  profile; removing the page's own tab first dropped the reload altogether. It was not tried on a
  Load unpacked copy, where failing would cost the user another Load unpacked.
- **A Karabiner rule running `open -a 'Brave Browser' 'chrome-extension://<id>/pick.html'`.** Brave
  accepts a `chrome-extension://` URL from `open`, unlike a `brave://` one (the session log recorded
  it). The rule was replaced by the extension's own shortcut, not abandoned for failing.

## Testing an extension without the user's Brave

A second, headless Brave on a scratch profile runs the real extension and leaves the user's browser
and session alone:

```bash
"/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser" --headless=new --user-data-dir="$SCRATCH/profile" --remote-debugging-port=9333 --no-first-run --disable-features=DisableLoadExtensionCommandLineSwitch --load-extension="$SCRATCH/target,$SCRATCH/extension"
```

- **Brave 1.95 honored `--load-extension`** with that feature disabled (not tried without it), and the
  manifest `key` gave the pinned id.
- **Drive it over CDP from node 24, which has a global `WebSocket`.** `Target.createTarget` a
  `chrome-extension://` page, `Target.attachToTarget` with `flatten: true`, then `Runtime.evaluate`
  with `awaitPromise`: extension APIs work there (`chrome.commands.getAll()` showed `⇧⌘,` assigned),
  and `Input.insertText` and `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` drive the page's own key handlers. Send
  `rawKeyDown` alone for a key that closes the page, or the `keyUp` fails with "Session with given id
  not found".
- **Load a second unpacked extension with an options page as the target** of anything that opens
  another extension's page.
- **It does not test the shortcut or the popup.** CDP key events go to the page rather than to Brave's
  accelerators (not tried), and headless has no toolbar for a popup. Test those in the user's Brave
  after the reload, with the `extensions.commands` check above first.
- **Stop it by its profile path**, `pkill -f -- "--user-data-dir=$SCRATCH/profile"`, which cannot match
  the user's Brave.
